        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the physical content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HMTL is short for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li>The HTML section communicates with browsers on proper encoding and language expected from the webpage.</li>
          <li>In most cases the encoding language used will be UTF-8.</li>
          <li>This refers to base 2 language representations and the byte sizes used for each character.</li>
          <li>HTML is the framework of a webpage and requires a sturdy foundation to build on. Think of it as building a house.</li>
          <li>It is made of elements and their nested content also known as a Parent/Child relationship.</li>
          <li>The elements consist of tags which divide information within the webpage.This makes it easier for developers to see what is going on.</li>
          <li>The elemetns fall into categories of Meta-Related, Content Division, and Semantic Elements.</li>
          <li>Elements and tags are denoted by angled brackets</li>
          <li>Attributes are added after a tag to further demonstrate the intention of the content and or elements section.</li>
          <li>Attributes are always defined at the beginning of the tag and never at the end.</li>
          <li>DOCTYPE's are demonstrative command's for the browser explaining the contents of it's accompanying attribute. In this case it is HTML</li>
          <li>Doctype isn't case sensitive, however the following attribute is.</li>
          <li>The head section is only viewable from a developer eye's and is not intended for the end user.</li>
          <li>The body section contains elements an end user will find viewable.</li>
